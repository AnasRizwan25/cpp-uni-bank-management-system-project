# Bank Management System (C++)
This is a simple Bank Management System built using C++ that allows users to manage accounts, including functionalities like creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, displaying account details, and deleting accounts. The system stores account data in a binary file, making it efficient for handling large numbers of accounts.

## Features:
- Create Account: Allows the user to create a new bank account by providing the account number, account holderâ€™s name, and initial balance.
- Deposit Money: Enables depositing an amount into a specified account.
- Withdraw Money: Enables withdrawing an amount from a specified account.
- Balance Inquiry: Displays the balance of a specified account.
- Delete Account: Deletes an account from the system based on the account number.
- Display All Accounts: Displays details of all accounts sorted by account number.
- Persistent Data: The system uses a binary file (accounts.dat) to store and retrieve account information.

## File Operations:
- Writing Account Data: Accounts are written to a binary file when created or updated.
- Reading Account Data: Accounts are read from the binary file for display or modification.
- Deleting an Account: Accounts are deleted from the file by rewriting the data to a temporary file, excluding the account to be deleted.

## Data Structures:
- Account Class: Contains account number, account holder's name, and balance. Includes methods for creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and displaying account details.
- Vector: Used to store and manage multiple accounts.

## Sorting:
- Bubble Sort: Accounts are sorted by account number before being displayed.
